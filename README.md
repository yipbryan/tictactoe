# tictactoe
Basic implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game between two human players

## Description
- Although I wrote this with no reference to other projects, the simplicity of the game means it may bear some similarity to other developers' implementations

## Instructions
- just run main.py to start the game (2 players with no inbuilt AI).
